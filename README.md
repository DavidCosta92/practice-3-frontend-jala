Create a tic tac toe game


### Requirements

1. Display a 3x3 grid UI by default.
2. Allow players to input "Player 1" and "Player 2" names.
3. Provide the option to start a new game.
4. Enable players to make moves and alternate turns.
5. When the game ends, display a message indicating the winner's name or if it is a tie.
6. The application must be responssive for mobile and tablet devices.

### Desirable
7. Add the ability to select the table dimensions, such as 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, etc.
8. Display the players' scores. Each time a player wins, 1 point will be added to their score. The total score for each player should be shown until the game is reset, at which point the scores will return to 0 for both players.
9. Host the project in Firebase, GitHub pages, or another tool.


Update the README file to include detailed instructions for running the project and a complete list of the tools used.
